  <h1>What’s IoTgo?</h1>

  <p>IoTgo is an open source IoT platform, like WordPress, ZenCart and all
    other open source software, you can deploy your own IoTgo cloud service.</p>

  <p>We at ITEAD Studio are committed to provide a complete set of hardware
    for IoTgo with open source hardware designs and open source firmware.</p>

  <p>The overall IoTgo system architecture including IoTgo, IoTgo-compatible
    apps and IoTgo-compatible devices is illustrated by following graph.</p>

      <h2>IoTgo Arduino Library</h2>

      <p>IoTgo Arduino Library is an embedded microcontroller SDK with reference
        firmware for Arduino boards. Users can define a device object directly by
        using this library and related methods to connect Arduino boards to IoTgo,
        which hugely simplify development process and save your time. What’s more,
        starters can write the hardware functional code on their own easily.</p>

      <p>For more information, please refer to

      <h2>Segnix &amp; IoTgo Segnix Library</h2>

      <p>Segnix is an open-source interface library for hardware manipulation
        based on Linux platform and compatible with
        <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage" target="_blank">Arduino API</a>
        You can develop on it by using C/C++ and Python. Segnix is dedicated to
        provide a fast, efficient and unified software development environment
        for the person like you with a strong electronic design idea.
      </p>

      <p>The latest Segnix contains IoTgo Segnix Library, and you can invoke
        various interfaces to manipulate devices. This is suitable for the rapid
        development of Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi and other single board computers.</p>

  <h1>Why IoTgo</h1>

  <p>Intelligent hardware project is comprehensive. To accomplish a project
    like that, it requires not only the proficient skills of hardware design
    and embedded devices coding, but also the reliable supports from cloud
    servers and web UI. No one could be good at all these areas in the same
    time. Before we launch IoTgo, it’s hard to find a complete IoT open
    source resource including hardware, firmware, server and web UI. Now,
    we provide this complete IoT open source solution for you.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-3">

        codes and libraries. For hardware part, you can just use our open
        sourced hardware designs. For cloud part, IoTgo is always here for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3>Website Designers</h3>

      <p>If you are experienced in server and website development, and despise
        our poor UI design, it’s OK! You can build the smart devices supported
        website with reasonable, simple and elegant design to meet your demand,
        and the hardware embedded coding is no problem. Without any modification,
        you can directly use the complete IoTgo hardware designs and firmware
        codes we provide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3>Development Team</h3>

      <p>If you have a team that is capable of doing all processes we mention
        above, we also hope that you can visit our IoT website and have it for
        reference. At least you don’t have to develop your project from nothing.
        Any suggestion is welcome.</p>
